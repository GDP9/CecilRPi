Should have sorted this out before...
Have now completed a basic conversion of the original Delphi code to Java.
Some jobs that need doing:
*Get the layout right so the memdump can be used
*Get the LED display(s) working
*Things like the video output aren't set up properly so the screen wraps
*None of the special locations are working (e.g. keyboard buffer)
*getkey isn't implemented
*Interrupts aren't implemented
*Do I want to include a storemx command?
*What about load and save?
*Help needs sorting out
*Can I get colour display working?
And there needs to be a general bug-finding sweep done.
